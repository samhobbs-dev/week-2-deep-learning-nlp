# Optional Exercises: Save/Load Models & Checkpoints

These exercises cover model persistence topics that were part of the original curriculum.
They are optional but useful for production deployment.

## Exercises

| Exercise | Topic | Starter File |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Model Persistence | Save/Load models in H5 and SavedModel formats | `starter_code/persistence_starter.py` |
| Checkpoint Strategy | Implement ModelCheckpoint callback | `starter_code/checkpoint_starter.py` |
| Regularization (Extended) | Deep dive into overfitting prevention | `starter_code/regularization_starter.py` |
| Production Pipeline | Complete training pipeline with versioning | `starter_code/production_pipeline_starter.py` |

## When to Use These

- After completing the main Transformer exercises
- When preparing models for deployment
- When you need to save training progress for long runs
